Hera 19
=======

Preliminaries
-------------

I'm looking at the CygA dataset, observed 09-Jun-2016/00:51:26.7 -
01:01:28.0. To reproduce Chris' results I've averaged to three minutes
using CASA split.


<<>>=
import os
import numpy

import matplotlib.pylab as plt

from clplot import clplot, clquants
from heraanalysis import *

msin="/fast/temp/casaclosure2/CygA.ms"

# Created a time averaged dat st
# split(msin, '/fast/temp/casaclosure2/CygA-timeavg.ms', datacolumn="all",  timebin='185s')
msavg='/fast/temp/casaclosure2/CygA-timeavg.ms'

<<caption="Histogram of the area of all triads in simulated HERA data">>=
p=clquants.triadArea(msin)
clplot.areaHist(p)
plt.show()

Thing to note: lots of triads with the same (small) areas, not all equilateral triangles.

Plot of one triad
-----------------

For initial test look at one triad only. I'm using triad 22, 9, 20 in
CASA notation (add one to get to Chris' numbers). I'm plotting versus
both frequency (horizontal axis) and time (different colours).

<<>>=


trset=[ [22, 9, 20] ]

<<caption="Closure Phase on triad 22-9-20 as function of frequency. The different traces correspond to different 3-minute integrations">>=
xx=clquants.closurePhTriads(msavg, trset)

for i in range(len(trset)):
   # Dont plot last one because it won't be have as much data averaged into it
	plt.plot(xx[i,0,:,0:-1])
plt.show()

Whole triad set
---------------

Next I've looked at the following equilateral triangles entered by hand. 

<<>>=
trset=[ [72, 22, 105],
[112, 81, 22],
[97, 10, 81],
[105, 9, 88],
[22, 20, 9],
[81, 89, 20],
[10, 43, 89],
[9, 64, 88],
[9, 53, 64],
[20, 53, 9],
[20, 31, 53],
[89, 31, 20],
[89, 65, 31],
[43, 65, 89],
[64, 53, 80]]
