Closure tests
=============

Preliminaries
-------------

import matplotlib.pylab as plt

d_fg=os.path.join(datadir, "FOREGROUND.H37.ms")
d_21=os.path.join(datadir, "21cm.H37.ms")

Closure Phase -- as in Memo 13
------------------------------

This is for comparison to the HERA memo 13 of Carilli & Sims. 

<<caption="Closure phase for simulated HERA data; blue line (not visible due to overplot by green) is the foreground only signal; green line is the 21cm only signal; green is the signal from combined 21cm signal and the foreground. ">>=
def plotcomp(fl, tr):
    p=map(lambda msin: clquants.closurePh(msin, alist=tr),
          fl)
    clplot.phaseSpec([x["phase"][0] for x in p], tr=tr)
    plt.show()
plotcomp([d_fg, d_21, d_comb], [1,2,6])

Closure Amplitude 
-----------------

This is an initial result of the closure amplitude investigation. I've
used files FOREGROUND.H37.ms, 21cm.H37.ms and 21CM+FG.H37.ms from
Carilli's\&Sim's HERA simulation. I've selected two quads at without
regard to area/orientation.

Upper panel shows the  total signals for three models: blue line (not visible due to overplot by green) is the foreground only signal; green line is the 21cm only signal; green is the signal from combined 21cm signal and the foreground. Lower panel shows the difference between combined 21cm and foreground signal on one hand and the 21cm signal only on the other hand">>=

    clplot.ampSpec([pp["amp"][0] for pp in p], qd=qd)
    plt.subplot(212)
    clplot.ampSpec(p[2]["amp"][0]- p[0]["amp"][0])
    plt.title(clplot.twrap("quad-%i-%i-%i-%i: Difference between the combined 21+foreground and the foreground-only signal " % tuple(qd) ))
